# TaskManagerAngular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.5 and update to version 18.0.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component components/component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
Also, can be abbreviated like `ng g c components/component-name`. Some things like services are automatically named with a "Service" at the of the end of the class name, so you don't need 
to put the "service" word in the name: `ng g s services/auth` in this case the class will be named as AuthService by default

## Configuration File
In src/assets/config.json you can find some variables that will be used in the development env. 
One of them is for example `"apiUrl"`, you could change this if you need for the api url in your machine, for example: 
```json
{
  "apiUrl": "localhost:8080"
}
```
